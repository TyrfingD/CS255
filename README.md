A collection of works created for the course
# CS255

The projects for this course involved fulfilling a hypothetical contract with a business called DriverPass. DriverPass planned to sell driving lessons to prospective drivers looking to pass their driving exams, and the company needed a website that could serve that purpose.

I think I did particularly well on my documentation. While I see mistakes in each of my diagrams, my requirements and design documents seem clear and thorough.

If I could only revise one part of these projects, it would be my sequence diagram. Specifically, I need to make sure my conditional loops all have an alternate sequence. Can't be conditional with only one path.

Ultimately, the client is designing the system for the user. The user is the company's source of revenue, so in a way they are the ones paying for the contract. No matter what I think of the system or what DriverPass thinks of the system, the success of the project is based on whether the users can, or will, use it.

This class has taught me there is a structure to the analysis and design process. Starting with the initial plans for the system which probably involve determining a rough schedule, then moving on to analysis where I would gather data through interviews or other research to refine the plan, and then on to the design stage where I might make some prototypes before creating and implementing the system.
